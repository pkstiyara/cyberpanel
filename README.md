# Installing CyberPanel
Step 1: Connect to your server via SSH
The installation of CyberPanel is quite simple. First, log into your server via SSH as the root user (sudo will not work). You can get the login details from your web host.

sudo yum check-update
sudo yum update
Step 2: Run the installation script

sh <(curl https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh || wget -O - https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh)

If, for some reason, you are not able to log in as root, you can use this command

sudo su - -c "sh <(curl https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh || wget -O - https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh)"
